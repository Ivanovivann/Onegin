"Now that he is in grave condition,
'When will the Devil haul you off?'"
And think behind a stifled cough:
And venture not a step away:
But what a bore, I ask you, brothers,
Dose him with melancholy bearing,
Has earned himself my recognition;
Is there hypocrisy more glaring
May his idea inspire others;
My uncle, decorous old prune,
Shake up the pillow for his head,
Than to amuse one all but dead,
To tend a patient night and day
What could have been more opportune?
